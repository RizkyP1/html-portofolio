<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Rizky Pratama. Since I was little, I always like to draw what's inside my head. There are a lot of abstrack drawings that I have made in the past, because I see the world is not monotonous. Maybe it's because I always watched Doramen since I was little, ha ha. I love to imagine things that don't seem real but can be useful one day.</p>

<p>My favorite food is made from potatoes.Such as cakes, balado potatoes, pencok, etc. I also like cassava plants.When it is harvested, it is made into chips. I may not be able to stop eating it. My hobby since I was a kid was often curious about things around me. Sometimes I look for wood to collect and then arrange according to my imagination.</p>
